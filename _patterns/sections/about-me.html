    <p class="push-0 milli">I'm a Curly redhead motion designer. I could tell you the full life story but I will spare you the pain of having to read a lot and just summarize why I do what I do.
    Everything has a story waiting to be told and I want to tell them in a easy and empathetic way. I use my life experiences, giant appetite for learning and new techniques to captivate those stories through my Motion Design and illustrations. </p>
