    <p class="push-0 milli">I'm a Curly redhead motion designer. I could tell you the full story of my life so far but I will spare you the pain of having to read a lot and just summarize why I do what I do.
    Everything has a complex story waiting to be told and I want to tell them in a digestible and empathetic way. I use my life experiences and my giant appetite for learning new techniques in order to captivate those stories through my Motion Design and illustrations. </p>
