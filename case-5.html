  <b>GOAL:</b> The goal of this project is to create a social media video that when swiping through fastly will grab people's attention in order to shine light on this small but important topic.<br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> I emphasized the client's branding by h warm and caring personality in the animation by giving texture and creating a hand drawn feeling to the frame-by-frame animation. By giving white space to make the animation, it created a delicate tone that sticks out and grabs the audience’s attention.
  I carried out the same hand drawn effect by having Joey’s name write on as if he himself was signing it." %}
