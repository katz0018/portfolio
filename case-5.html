<b>GOAL:</b> The goal of this project is to create a social media video that when swiping through fastly will grab people's attention in order to shine light on this small but important topic.<br><br>

<b>RATIONALE:</b>I created this project to be 80's Retro feel. I acheived this by adding an off white background and the font for the text at the end of the video is Garamond, which is a very thick font used a lot in 80's videos. The reason I do incorporate music is to make the laughter stand out out even more, and create a raw feel. The purpose of having the diffrent styled rotocope is to represent diversity and the idea that it doesnt matter what background you come from, laughing is contagious to everyone. " %}
