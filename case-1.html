  <b>CLIENT:</b> Dineen Coffee Co.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> Dineen pride them selves on the fact that one of there location's is built within one of the oldest heritage buildings in Toronto while having a modern twist to the shop itself. In order to maintain this aesthetic, I brought this into the animation by adding a gold effect combined with a trendier illustration style." %}

I then saw this gold letter stamp which gave me the idea of combining this gold stamp with the icon's that will be appearing in the animation. The animation itself incorporates three main subjects that the coffeshop stands out for: there coffee, baked goods, and location." %}
