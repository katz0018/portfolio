  <b>CLIENT:</b> Dineen Coffee Co.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> Dineen pride them selves on the fact that they are built within one of the oldest heritage buildings in Toronto while having a modern twist to the shop's branding. In order to maintain this aesthetic, I added a gold effect to resemble a 1920 art deco. The illustration style was made using flat design to give a modern twist to the animation." %}

The animation itself incorporates three main subjects that the coffee shop are reconized for: the coffee, baked goods, and the location." %}
