{% pattern sections/project-description text="<b>CLIENT:</b>Greta Thunberg<br>
<b>TARGET AUDIENCE:</b>Teens and Young adults who are enviromentally contious.<br>
<b>GOAL:</b>To create a website using parallax and that would be effective in communicating well what Greta Thunberg is stands for to other individuals who don't know about her and would like to donate or simply know more.<br>
<b>RATIONALE:</b> I emphasized Joey’s warm and caring personality in the animation by giving texture and creating a hand drawn feeling to the frame-by-frame animation. By giving white space to make the animation, it created a delicate tone that sticks out and grabs the audience’s attention.
I carried out the same hand drawn effect by having Joey’s name write on as if he himself was signing it." %}
