{% pattern sections/project-description text="<b>TARGET AUDIENCE:</b>Motion Design agencies, industry companies looking to create explainer videos of their products/services.<br><br>
<b>GOAL:</b>Create a motion piece that highlights that my drive is to tell stories through my motion, illustration and experiences.<br><br>
<b>RATIONALE:</b>The black and white photos represent my real life experiences. In fact each photo used in this motion piece was taken by me and then later manipulated through photoshop. I made the video have flow to hit the ques of the music, and to keep the audience captivated. I used this baby blue to create a calm tone like the classical music." %}
