<b>CLIENT:</b> Joey Kidney - Stay you<br><br>

<b>GOAL:</b> To create an intro for Joey kidney’s YouTube channel that translates his branding. His channel is about creating a safe place for teenagers to come listen to him speak about topics such as mental wellness and relationships.<br><br>

<b>RATIONALE:</b> I emphasized Joey’s warm and caring personality in the animation by giving texture and creating a hand drawn feeling to the frame-by-frame animation. By giving white space to make the animation, it creates a delicate tone that sticks out and grabs the audience’s attention.
I carried out the same hand drawn effect by having Joey’s name write on as if he himself was signing the video." %}

He wanted a intro for his youtube videos that was subtle, coherent with his branding, and inviting. I began to then doing a rough animation of the frame by frame, skimming through multple times to add inbetween frames that would make the animation smoother. Once I was content with the base animation I added in textures and any colouring." %}
