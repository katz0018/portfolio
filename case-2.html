<b>CLIENT:</b> Joey kidney-Stay you<br><br>

<b>GOAL:</b> To create an intro for Joey kidney’s YouTube channel that was subtle but still with a clear message that his YouTube channel is the kind you can grab a hot drink and relax while listening to him talk about important topics all teenagers should listen to.<br><br>

<b>RATIONALE:</b> I emphasized Joey’s warm and caring personality in the animation by giving texture and creating a hand drawn feeling to the frame-by-frame animation. By giving white space to make the animation, it created a delicate tone that sticks out and grabs the audience’s attention.
I carried out the same hand drawn effect by having Joey’s name write on as if he himself was signing it." %}
