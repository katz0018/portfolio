Ever since I was little I thought that peoples stories of how they came to be, was linear. It wasn't until I started modeling at 15 that I realized nobody's story is one path alone but instead is many paths that spread to only come back together in the end. I could tell you my full story of my life but I will spare you the pain of having to read a lot and just summarize why I do what I do. Everything has a story waiting to be told and I want to make sure they are heard so when people are on there life journey's, they will be able to relate with those stories.
