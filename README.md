Ever since I was little I thought that peoples stories were linear. I thought it was as simple as saying "I want to be and astraunut" and boom, one day you are. It wasn't until I started modeling at 15 that I realized that's false and that a more realistic view of stoies is much more complex. Instead of a linear path, it's one giant ball of intertwinning paths that lead's into one.<br class="push-1-2">I could tell you the full story of my life so far but I will spare you the pain of having to read a lot and just summarize why I do what I do. Everything has a complex story waiting to be told and I want to tell those stories in a way more digestable through my motion Graphics.
